## Targeting

### Segmentation

#### Topics

Our targeting options include, but are not limited to:

* 

### Geographic Segmentation

We also support geo-targeting to the country level. This allows you to target your
messages to specific countries of interest, or exclude a set of countries that aren't
relevant to your ads.

## UTM Params

Each campaign can be configured to redirect to whichever URL you specify. This can include
UTM parameters. We do automatically place a `utm_referrer` on the redirect URL that includes the referring URL of the property the ad appeared on. This will help you know which publishers are performing the best and which are not.

## Reported Statistics

We track statistics on our own platform, and report them to you at via the advertiser
dashboard.

We do not track, nor provide, any identifiable information for ad viewers.

## Limitations

We believe that a major issue with the advertising industry is the tracking of users with
third-party scripts.

**To address this, we don't allow any third-party scripts to be run in
our ad placements.**

## Ad Creatives

Our publishers have the option of selecting from numerous ad templates to use on their properties.

Each template uses an ad creative that follows these guidelines:

* Ad creative **headline** + **body** should not be more than **84 characters long**.
* Banner image may not be animated.
* We recomment the use of ðŸ‘‹ emoji when it makes sense, but don't overuse it.

We are software developers first and foremost. We will help you craft a message that resonates with the developer community if needed.
